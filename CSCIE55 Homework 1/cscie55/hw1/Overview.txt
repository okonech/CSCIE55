HW1 Elevator

To run: "java -classpath hw1.jar cscie55.hw1.elevatortest.ElevatorTest"

Elevator will move 1 floor per call to move() and will unload passengers if they are going to the current floor.
The logic for this is:
Change direction if necessary
Move 1 floor in the current direction
Update arrays based on the current floor

For ease of coding, I did not use offset 0 in the arrays so that the floor (starts at 1) can be passed in as an index directly.
I added a static max floors variable referenced in ElevatorTest so the # of floors can be changed in the one place in Elevator.

The main method sets up the 3 necessary passengers, prints the initial state and runs a for loop MAX_FLOORS*2-1 times so that the elevator moves all the way up and down.

Since move() only moves 1 floor at a time,
it doesn't really use the array tracking which floors require a stop for anything (it updates the array but it doesn't affect code execution).
It needs to since ElevatorTest needs to print the current state on each floor after every move, which would not be possible if a single move() moved floors until a stop was required.
