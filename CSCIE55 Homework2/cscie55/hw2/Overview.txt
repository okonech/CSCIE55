HW2

Elevator will move 1 floor per call to move() and will unload passengers if they are going to the current floor.
The logic for this is:
Change direction if necessary
Move 1 floor in the current direction
Board passengers from Floor objects (communicating through Building) and assume they are bound for ground floor.
Update arrays based on the current floor (add,release passengers)

For ease of coding, I did not use offset 0 in the arrays so that the floor (starts at 1) can be passed in as an index directly.

Due to the HW restriction on additional public methods, Floor's boardPassenger() is protected instead. I needed some way for Elevator to
tell Floor to reduce the count of waiting passengers.
